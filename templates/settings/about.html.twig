            <h3 class="text-muted">How it Works</h3>
            <p>Opium isn't a publisher, but it is a platform for you to share your own work.</p>
            <p>Essays are meant to be a form of creative expression. Don't feel forced to try to prove a point.</p>
            <p>Each essay you post goes through a 3-day embargo. This is an intentional choice not a technical limitation.</p>
            <p>We strongly encourage you to think through your post in that time period.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Does it address everything you wanted it to</li>
                <li>How will others interpret it</li>
                <li>Could it be more focused</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Second-guessing is natural during this time period.</p>
            <p>You are able to delete your post while it's in embargo. Once it goes live it is a permanent feature of the website.</p>
            <p>There's no way to delete your posts or your account so please be mindful of everything you post.</p>
            <p>Also cite your sources.</p>

            <h3 class="text-muted">The Rules</h3>
            <p>Violating any of these will have your life and your account terminated permanently</p>

            <h3 class="text-muted">The World According to Jaden</h3>

                <ul class="text-md-start">
                    <li>Images, videos, and bright colors are designed to be distracting and attention grabbing</li>

                    <li>Targeted advertising by selling user data are both immoral</li>
                    <li>Time is a luxury... take advantage of it </li>
                    <li>People should have an unbiased outlet to fully express themselves not constrained by...</li>
                    <ul>

                        <li>A 3 minute timer</li>
                        <li>Or an advertising driven business model</li>
